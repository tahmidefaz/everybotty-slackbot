### Deployment
You can use the above steps to deploy the slackbot anywhere.
We have only tried the cloud deployment with [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and local deployment with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). A heroku Procfile is provided for your convenience.


## Slack App configurations

#### OAuth & Permissions

You will the the following OAuth Scopes as the Bot Token Scopes

* `app_mentions:read`
* `channels:history`
* `chat:write`
* `chat:write.customize`

#### Event Subscriptions

You will need to enable events subscriptions for your slack bot.

* Point to the correct request URL for the events where your bot server is set up. Don't forget to append `/slack/events` at the end.
* Subscribe to the following "bot events":
  * `app_mention`
  * `message.channels`

That should be all you need. Install the app in a slack workspace, add it to a channel and do `@<your-bot-name>`. Enjoy. ðŸ¤–
